# Prerequisites
## Python (3.5+) and background writing Python scripts. 
## OpenAI: 
OpenAI is a research organization and technology company that aims to ensure artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. One of its key contributions is the development of advanced LLMs such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. These models can understand and generate human-like text, making them powerful tools for various applications like chatbots, content creation, and more.
Sign up for OpenAI and copy your API keys from the API section in your account so that you can access the models.  Install OpenAI on your computer using the command below:
pip install openai

## LangChain:
LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that leverage LLMs. It provides tools and utilities to manage and streamline the various aspects of working with LLMs, making building complex and robust applications easier.
Install LangChain on your computer using the command below:
pip install langchain
 
## Streamlit: 
Streamlit is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for creating web applications. Streamlit allows you to create interactive web applications using Python alone. You don't need expertise in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to build functional and visually appealing web apps.
It's beneficial for building machine learning and data science apps, including those that utilize LLMs. Install streamlit on your computer using the command below:
pip install streamlit
